# S-DES (Simplified-Data Encryption standard) -by-VERILOG 

## The S-DES encryption algorithm: 
1) 8-bit block of plaintext 
2) 10-bit key as input  
3) Produces an 8-bit block of ciphertext as output


## The Encryption algorithm involves five functions: 
1) An initial permutation (IP).
2) A complex function labeled fK, which involves both permutation and substitution operations and depends on a key input. 
3) A simple permutation function that switches (SW) the two halves of the data.
4) The function fK again. 
5) A permutation function that is the inverse of the initial permutation (IPâ€“1).
6) ##### We can concisely express the encryption algorithm as a composition of functions:
